<h2><u>Rules for Prison Builders</u></h2>
<ol>
    <li>Permanent lag machines are not allowed.</li>
    <li>Spawn-killing is not allowed. Also, you can't ban the prisoner at all times.</li>
    <li>All parts of the prison must be buildable in the same version of minecraft (and server version), i.e. you cannot use glitches from earlier versions and combine that with features from newer versions.</li>
    <li>Continuing 3), the prison must be buildable in survival with no cheats. You can create the world in creative mode, but it's invalid if you could not make it in survival.</li>
    <li>It must be possible for a visitor to meet the prisoner. If the prisoner and visitor are in the same room, or are even separated by glass, that is allowed.</li>
    <br><i style="font-size:60%;">Note: visiting processes such as "Visitor stands on top of prison and uses X-ray texture pack", "Visitor stands on top of prison and spams F3+A", "Visitor stands in portal and spams F3+A" are not valid.</i>
    <li>It must be possible to let the prisoner out.</li>
    <li>Blocking off an entire dimension, in particular the end, is usually considered invalid.</li>
    <li>Assume the workings of the prison are entirely public.</li>
    <li>Perfect 24/7 guards are incredibly frowned-upon. Using them will probably be laughed out. Additionally, using guards at all outside of a visit is a sign that there may be something wrong with the prison; they are not invalid, but consider only using a couple AFK guards that can wake up if an alarm goes off.</li>
    <li>(Sigh) Prisons cannot be made or guarded with plugins or outside software.</li>
</ol>
<h2><u>Rules for Escapists</u></h2>
<ol>
    <li>The prisoner must, at some point, be willingly imprisoned in the cell. That means that the guards must think they have no items (unless it's involuntary) and cannot escape.</li>
    <li>Assume the guards are intelligent and know the way around the prison.</li>
    <li>Using a mechanic that is secret is invalid unless the method is fully released.</li>
    <li>If your escape method is universal or semi-universal (works on a large category of prisons) it may be considered invalid.</li>
    <li>(Double sigh) No modified clients that makes something impossible in vanilla minecraft possible.</li>
</ol>
