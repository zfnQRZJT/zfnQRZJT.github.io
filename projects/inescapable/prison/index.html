The 3 low security cells have a single layer of water on the floor. The walls are two-block-thick cobblestone generators, and the floor regenerates as well. In the 2 high security cells, similar to glacier's orb, the prisoner stands on a small platform with lava on the walls and floor that are too far to reach, meaning the prisoner will die if they jump off of their platform. In all 5 cells, guards can easily watch the prisoners via composters. Also, respawning and visitor entry is done from the ceiling. The guards can enter any cell with a keycard.

Anyone trying to enter via a portal will be put in a portal trap where if any block is broken the guards will also be notified. In the nether and overworld, there are an empty ring of chests. If anyone tries to break in, ban items will be filtered into chests and this will cause the attacker to get scared and the guards to get even more scared.","More security","Many doors in the prison are keycard locked, meaning it is harder to get places after infiltrating the guard areas. The guards have stasis chambers inside the prison so they can be called. There are multiple elder guardian chambers which affect the entirety of the prison, and there are various conduits to give the players inside the prison conduit power if the guards activate them. Most of the redstone lines in the prison are composed of observers, giving the guards a lot of visibility when they are in composters. Some killchecks are done in the nether, meaning it is somewhat difficult to smuggle items even into the main part of the prison. Guards can leave the prison via a toggleable portal. At one of the killchecks, the player will respawn in lava, die, and respawn a second time in the main path.

There is an end portal so prisoners can go to the end, and they can also go to the nether. When coming back from the end, prisoners will be trapped in a detecting, inventory banning death box which, once they die in it, will open another respawn point for a few seconds to let them respawn in the cell. The roof detector also functions as the top detector for the cell. Since it's made of glass, signs, and tripwires, the sky is visible through it. In the nether, there are also a lot of detectors surrounding the region in which the cell can generate a portal.","More Security","The prison is surrounded, in the overworld, by many submerged fox boxes which are themselves surrounded by some weak wither walls. If someone decides the wither walls are not worth their effort and attempts to wither above them, they will hit a budded piston wall that triggers the suicide on the inside.","Prison Video",["tmz-O2JM51E"],"Escape Videos",["V7iSo-dsmzI","EdOZf9xQkNY","XfrmAzEPxzA","uVlzxSWQQVk"]],["LEON"]],

Visiting is not a possible escape method as the visiting process involves the visitor spamming F3+A at a point barely less than 48 blocks from the prisoner, due to the unique triple outer foxban layout and small interior.
